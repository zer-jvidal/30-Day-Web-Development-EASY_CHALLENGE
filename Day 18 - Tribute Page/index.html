        All We Know Is Falling is the debut studio album by Paramore, released on July 26, 2005. The album blends pop-punk and emo-rock elements, showcasing the band’s youthful energy and emotional depth.
        <br> Its themes center around loss, separation, and change, inspired partly by bassist Jeremy Davis’s temporary departure from the band.
        <br> Featuring standout tracks like “Pressure,” “Emergency,” and “All We Know,” the album introduced Hayley Williams’ powerful vocals and set the foundation for Paramore’s rise in the alternative rock scene.

<p>
The album cover art visually represents the band’s sense of loss — it shows a red couch with a shadow walking away, symbolizing the departure of bassist Jeremy Davis, whose exit deeply influenced the album’s emotional tone. 
<br>The “falling” in the title also ties into this theme, reflecting both personal and musical instability the band experienced during its early days.

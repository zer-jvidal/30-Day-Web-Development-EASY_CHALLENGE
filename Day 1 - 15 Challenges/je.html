<p class="good">Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic, and writer known for his profound and often provocative ideas about morality, religion, and the nature of existence. <br>
    He challenged traditional values and the foundations of Western thought, famously declaring that “God is dead,” a statement reflecting his view that modern society had moved beyond the need for religious belief.
    <br> Nietzsche explored concepts such as the “Übermensch” (Overman), the “will to power,” and “eternal recurrence,” encouraging individuals to create their own values and live authentically in a world without inherent meaning.
    <br> His work deeply influenced existentialism, psychology, and modern philosophy, leaving a legacy that continues to spark debate and interpretation today.

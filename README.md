# 30-Day Web Development Challenge

### 🚀 Objective

A structured 30-day sprint designed to **get started** with modern web development using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The focus is simple: build foundational familiarity through consistent, bite-sized learning.
Each day increases in difficulty by roughly **0.5%**, allowing steady progress without overwhelm.

This challenge prioritizes momentum over perfection — learning slowly, but surely.

### 📂 Repository Overview

This repository documents hands-on practice throughout the challenge. It includes:

* **Code Exercises:** Focused drills to strengthen core understanding
* **Mini Mock-Up Projects:** Small interface builds to apply concepts in realistic scenarios
* **Project Milestones:** Progressive builds that reflect gradual skill growth

The goal is not to build a SaaS product or a full-scale application — but to develop solid fundamentals through structured repetition and incremental difficulty.
